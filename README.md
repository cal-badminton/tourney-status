# TourneyStatus
Web app for managing tournaments and displaying tournament status to players. Tournament managers can create a tourney to assist in managing matches, and players can view information on who's playing and who's next.

Superseded by the new [Tourney Map!](https://github.com/cal-badminton/tourney-map)
